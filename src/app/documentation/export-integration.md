# üì§ Export & Integration Features Documentation

## What are Export & Integration Features?

Export & Integration Features are like having a **universal translator** for your AI data. Think of them as the "Save As" and "Share" buttons for everything you do with AI - letting you get your data out in any format you need and connect with other tools you already use.

Just like how you can export a spreadsheet as PDF, CSV, or Excel, our platform lets you export your AI conversations, analytics, cost reports, and model comparisons in multiple formats for use anywhere.

## Why Do You Need Export & Integration?

### The Problem Without Export Capabilities

Using AI without export features is like taking photos but never being able to share them:

**‚ùå You can't:**
- Share AI insights with your team or clients
- Use AI data in presentations or reports
- Import usage data into your accounting software
- Backup your valuable AI conversations
- Analyze data in your preferred tools

**‚ùå This leads to:**
- Manual copy-paste of important information
- Lost insights and conversations
- Inability to prove ROI to stakeholders
- No integration with existing workflows
- Data trapped in one platform

### How Export & Integration Helps

**‚úÖ You get:**
- One-click export in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Excel, PDF, Markdown)
- Seamless integration with popular tools
- Automated data sharing and backup
- Professional reports for stakeholders
- Complete data portability

**‚úÖ This means:**
- Easy sharing and collaboration
- Professional presentations and reports
- Integration with existing business tools
- Never lose important AI insights
- Complete control over your data

## Understanding Export Types

### 1. Model Exports

**What it exports:** Information about AI models and their performance

**Use cases:**
- Create model comparison reports for team decisions
- Share model leaderboards with stakeholders
- Document model selection rationale
- Track model performance over time

**Example export content:**
```

## Troubleshooting Export Issues

### Common Problems

**Export fails or times out:**
```bash
# Check export status
hive export status

# Retry failed export
hive export retry last

# Reduce export size
hive export analytics --timeframe week --format csv
```

**Missing data in exports:**
```bash
# Verify data exists
hive analytics status

# Check export filters
hive export config show

# Export with verbose logging
hive export analytics --format csv --verbose
```

**Large file sizes:**
```bash
# Use more efficient formats
hive export analytics --format csv  # instead of PDF

# Filter data by date
hive export conversations --last 30d

# Compress exports
hive export config --compress true
```

### Performance Optimization

**Faster exports:**
- Use CSV format for large datasets
- Filter by date ranges to reduce data size
- Export during off-peak hours
- Use batch exports for multiple types

**Smaller file sizes:**
- Enable compression in export config
- Exclude unnecessary metadata
- Use JSON for structured data
- Filter out unused fields
