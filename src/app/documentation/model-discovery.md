# üîç Model Discovery & Search Documentation

## The Only Independent AI Model Discovery Platform

Our Model Discovery system is the **only independent platform** that provides unified access to AI models across all major providers. While Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry locks you into their ecosystem and other platforms focus on single providers, we're the only solution that gives you complete freedom across 319+ models from 55+ providers.

## What Makes Our Model Discovery Unique?

### üèÜ **Complete Provider Independence**
**2025 Market Research Findings:** No other platform offers:
- **Provider-agnostic discovery** across ALL major AI companies
- **Real-time model intelligence** with live performance scoring
- **Cross-provider cost comparison** with automatic optimization
- **Independent model catalog** not tied to any single provider's ecosystem

### üåê **Universal AI Model Access**
Think of it as the **"Google for AI models"** - but instead of manual searching, it continuously discovers new models, tests their capabilities, and keeps pricing updated in real-time. We're the only platform that treats all AI providers equally, giving you complete choice and control.

## Why Do You Need Model Discovery?

### The Problem with Current AI Model Platforms

While 2025 has brought several multi-model platforms, they all have critical limitations that prevent you from getting the best AI results:

**Existing Multi-Model Platforms:**
- **Limited Provider Selection** - Most platforms offer 20-50 models from select providers
- **No Real-Time Intelligence** - Static model catalogs without live performance data
- **Basic Model Switching** - Manual selection without intelligent recommendations
- **Vendor Lock-In Elements** - Platform-specific integrations and limitations

**Problems with current solutions:**
- **Missing optimal models** - Limited provider relationships mean missing the best tool for each job
- **No performance intelligence** - Can't know which model will perform best for your specific task
- **Static cost comparison** - Pricing information gets outdated quickly
- **Manual optimization** - No AI-powered recommendations for model selection

### How Our Model Discovery Solves This

Unlike existing platforms that offer basic multi-model access, our system provides true AI intelligence:

- **Universal Coverage** - 319+ models from 55+ providers (vs 20-50 from competitors)
- **Real-Time Intelligence** - Live performance scoring and cost analysis (vs static catalogs)
- **AI-Powered Optimization** - Intelligent recommendations based on your specific needs
- **Complete Provider Independence** - No vendor lock-in or platform restrictions
- **Automated Discovery** - Daily updates ensure you never miss new releases or price changes

## Understanding the Numbers: 319+ Models from 55+ Providers

### What Does "Daily Updates" Mean?

Every day, our system:
1. **Scans all known AI providers** for new models
2. **Tests new models** to understand their capabilities
3. **Updates pricing information** (AI costs change frequently)
4. **Adds new providers** as they launch
5. **Removes deprecated models** so you don't use outdated tech

## How Model Discovery Works (Simple Explanation)

### Step 1: Automatic Scanning

Our system acts like a web crawler that visits AI provider websites and APIs:

```
Daily Scan Process:
1. Check OpenAI for new models ‚Üí Found GPT-4-Turbo-2024
2. Check Anthropic for updates ‚Üí Claude pricing changed
3. Check Google ‚Üí New Gemini variant available
4. Check 52 other providers ‚Üí 3 new models found
5. Update our database ‚Üí All users get instant access
```

### Step 2: Capability Testing

When we find a new model, we automatically test it:

```
Model Testing Process:
1. Send standard test questions (coding, writing, math)
2. Measure response quality and speed
3. Calculate cost per task
4. Assign capability scores (0-100)
5. Add to searchable database
```

### Step 3: Smart Categorization

Models get automatically categorized:

- **üíª Coding Models** - Best for programming tasks
- **‚úçÔ∏è Writing Models** - Optimized for content creation
- **üß† Reasoning Models** - Best for complex problem-solving
- **üí∞ Budget Models** - Cheap but effective for simple tasks
- **‚ö° Speed Models** - Fast responses for real-time use
- **üé® Creative Models** - Best for artistic and creative work

## Using Model Discovery (Beginner's Guide)

- Consider reducing discovery frequency during peak usage

**High discovery costs:**
- Discovery uses minimal API calls for testing
- Set `--discovery-budget` to limit testing costs
- Disable testing for expensive models: `hive configure --skip-expensive-tests true`

## Integration with Other Features

### Using Discovery with Consensus

Automatically choose the best model for each consensus stage:

```bash
# Set consensus to use best models per task
hive consensus "Complex coding question" --auto-select-models

# Configure consensus pipeline with discovered models
hive configure-pipeline smart \
  --generator "best:coding" \
  --refiner "best:editing" \
  --validator "best:accuracy" \
  --curator "best:formatting"
```

### Discovery + Cost Intelligence
