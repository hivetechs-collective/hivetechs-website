# üìä Analytics & Insights Documentation

## What is Analytics & Insights?

Analytics & Insights is like having a personal data scientist that watches how you use AI and gives you smart recommendations to save money and improve results. It's like having a fitness tracker, but for your AI usage instead of your steps.

Imagine if your smartphone told you: "You used maps 50 times this month, spending 3 hours in traffic. Here's a better route that saves 20 minutes daily." That's exactly what our analytics does for your AI usage.

## Why Do You Need Analytics?

### The Problem Without Analytics

Using AI without analytics is like driving with your eyes closed:

**‚ùå You don't know:**
- How much you're spending on AI each month
- Which AI models work best for your tasks
- When you're wasting money on expensive models for simple questions
- How to optimize your usage for better results

**‚ùå This leads to:**
- Surprise bills at the end of the month
- Using the wrong (expensive) model for simple tasks
- Missing opportunities to save money
- Poor performance because you don't know what works

### How Analytics Helps

**‚úÖ You get:**
- Real-time spending tracking (like a budget app)
- Smart recommendations (like Netflix suggestions, but for AI models)
- Usage patterns (see when and how you use AI most)
- Cost optimization tips (automatic money-saving suggestions)

**‚úÖ This means:**
- Predictable, controlled AI spending
- Always using the best model for each task
- Automatic alerts before you overspend
- Continuously improving results

## How Analytics Works (Simple Explanation)

### Step 1: Automatic Tracking

Every time you use hive-tools, the system automatically records:

```
üìù What gets tracked:
- Question asked: "How do I center a div?"
- Model used: GPT-4
- Response time: 3.2 seconds
- Cost: $0.045
- Success: ‚úÖ Good response
- Category: Coding question
- Time: 2:30 PM, Tuesday
```

**This happens automatically** - you don't need to do anything.

### Step 2: Smart Analysis

The system analyzes your patterns:

```
üîç Pattern Recognition:
- 60% of questions are about coding
- Most coding questions could use cheaper models
- You spend most on Thursday afternoons
- GPT-3.5 works just as well for simple tasks
- You're spending 40% more than needed
```

### Step 3: Intelligent Recommendations

Based on your patterns, you get suggestions:

```
üí° Smart Insights:
"You asked 15 coding questions this week using GPT-4 ($1.23).
Claude-3-Haiku could handle 12 of these for $0.18.
Potential savings: $1.05/week ($54/year)"

"Your usage spiked 200% on Thursday. Consider setting 
a daily budget alert to avoid surprises."
```

## Understanding Your Analytics Dashboard

## Getting Smart Insights

### Understanding Insights

Insights are like having an AI consultant analyze your usage and give personalized advice:

```bash
# Get all insights
hive analytics insights

# Cost-focused insights
hive analytics insights --focus cost

# Performance-focused insights
hive analytics insights --focus performance

# Weekly insight summary
hive analytics insights --weekly-summary
```

### Types of Insights You'll Get

**üí∞ Cost Optimization Insights:**
```
"You spent $15.30 this week vs $11.20 last week (+37%).
The increase came from using GPT-4 for simple questions.

Recommendation: Create a 'simple_questions' profile using 
GPT-3.5-Turbo. This could save you $8.20/month."
```

**‚ö° Performance Optimization Insights:**
```
"Your average response time increased to 4.2 seconds.
This is because 60% of requests went to slower models.

Recommendation: Use Claude-3-Haiku for quick tasks. 
It's 2x faster and 3x cheaper for simple questions."
```

**üìà Usage Pattern Insights:**
```
"Your AI usage peaks on Thursdays (3x normal volume).
You might be cramming work into one day.

Recommendation: Spread work across the week for better 
time management and more consistent costs."
```

**üéØ Model Selection Insights:**
```
"You're using GPT-4 for all coding tasks, but analysis 
shows Code Llama performs equally well for 80% of them.

Recommendation: Switch to Code Llama for routine coding.
Potential monthly savings: $23.50"
```

### Acting on Insights

The system doesn't just tell you what's wrong - it shows you how to fix it:

```bash
# Apply suggested optimizations
hive insights apply cost-optimization

# Create suggested profiles
hive insights apply profile-recommendations

# Set up suggested alerts
hive insights apply alert-recommendations
```

**Example Auto-Application:**
```
‚úÖ Applied cost optimization recommendations:

1. Created "simple_tasks" profile with GPT-3.5-Turbo
2. Set up budget alert at 80% of monthly limit  
3. Configured auto-model-selection for routine tasks
4. Enabled weekly cost review reminders

üí∞ Estimated monthly savings: $18.40 (35% reduction)
```

## Setting Up Analytics

### Basic Setup (Automatic)

Analytics work automatically, but you can customize them:

```bash
# Check analytics status
hive analytics status

# Enable/disable analytics
hive analytics enable
hive analytics disable

# Set privacy level (local only vs cloud sync)
hive analytics privacy local
```

### Configuring Budget Tracking

Set spending limits and alerts:

```bash
# Set monthly budget
hive analytics budget set 50

# Set spending alerts
hive analytics alerts add --threshold 80 --type percentage
hive analytics alerts add --threshold 40 --type absolute

# Daily spending limits
hive analytics daily-limit 5
```

**Example Budget Setup:**
```
üí∞ Budget Configuration:

Monthly Budget: $50.00
Current Spending: $12.45 (25%)
Remaining: $37.55

Alerts:
‚úÖ 50% budget used ($25) - Email notification
‚úÖ 80% budget used ($40) - Email + SMS
‚úÖ 90% budget used ($45) - All notifications + pause usage
‚úÖ Daily limit: $3.00 - Pause if exceeded

Next Alert: $12.55 remaining until 50% notification
```

### Custom Categories

Organize your analytics by creating custom categories:

```bash
# Create custom categories
