# 🚨 Real-time Monitoring & Alerts Documentation

## What is Real-time Monitoring & Alerts?

Real-time Monitoring & Alerts is like having a **smart security system** for your AI usage. Think of it as your AI's personal bodyguard - it watches everything 24/7, learns your normal patterns, and immediately alerts you when something unusual or problematic happens.

Just like how your phone alerts you when your battery is low or when someone tries to access your account, our monitoring system keeps watch over your AI usage and budget, alerting you before small issues become expensive problems.

## Why Do You Need Real-time Monitoring?

### The Problem Without Monitoring

Using AI without monitoring is like driving without looking at your dashboard:

**❌ You don't know when:**
- You're about to exceed your budget limit
- AI performance suddenly degrades
- There's an unusual spike in usage
- A specific AI provider is having issues
- Your costs are trending higher than normal

**❌ This leads to:**
- Surprise budget overruns and unexpected bills
- Poor performance going unnoticed for hours
- Missing optimization opportunities
- Reactive problem solving instead of prevention
- No early warning of system issues

### How Real-time Monitoring Helps

**✅ You get:**
- Instant notifications when issues arise
- Early warning before problems become expensive
- Automatic detection of unusual patterns
- Multi-channel alerts (email, desktop, webhook)
- Historical tracking of all incidents

**✅ This means:**
- Prevent budget overruns with advance warning
- Catch performance issues immediately
- Optimize usage based on real patterns
- Sleep well knowing your AI is monitored
- Proactive management instead of reactive fixes

## How Real-time Monitoring Works (Simple Explanation)

### Continuous Monitoring

Every few seconds, our system checks key metrics:

```
🔍 Monitoring Checks (Every 5 seconds):
✓ Current spending vs budget: $12.45 / $25.00 (49.8%)
✓ Response time: 2.8s (Normal - under 3s threshold)
✓ Success rate: 98.7% (Good - above 95% threshold)
✓ Request rate: 12/min (Normal - under 50/min threshold)
✓ Provider status: All providers responding normally
```

**This happens automatically** - you don't need to check manually.

### Smart Pattern Detection

The system learns your normal patterns and detects anomalies:

```
🧠 Pattern Learning:
Normal weekday usage: 20-40 requests/hour
Normal weekend usage: 5-15 requests/hour
Typical cost per day: $8-12
Average response time: 2.5-3.5 seconds

🚨 Anomaly Detection:
"Usage spike detected: 120 requests/hour (3x normal)"
"Cost trending high: $18 today vs $10 average"
"Response time degraded: 6.2s vs 2.8s normal"
```

### Intelligent Alerts

When issues are detected, you get immediate notifications:

```
📧 Email Alert:
Subject: "Budget Alert: 80% limit reached"
Body: "You've used $20 of your $25 daily budget. 
      Current trend suggests you'll reach the limit by 4 PM.
      Consider switching to cost-effective models."

🖥️ Desktop Notification:
"AI Performance Alert: Response time increased 40% in last hour"

📱 Webhook Alert:
POST to your-app.com/alerts
{
  "type": "budget_threshold",
  "severity": "warning",
  "current": 20.00,
  "limit": 25.00,
  "percentage": 80
}
```

## Understanding Alert Types

Next check: 4 seconds
```

### Configuring Notifications

Choose how you want to be alerted:

```bash
# Enable desktop notifications
hive monitoring config --desktop true

# Add email notifications
hive monitoring config --email your@email.com

# Add webhook for custom integrations
hive monitoring config --webhook https://your-api.com/alerts

# Configure multiple notification methods
hive monitoring config --notifications "desktop,email,webhook"
```

### Setting Custom Thresholds

Adjust alert triggers for your needs:

```bash
# Set budget alert thresholds
hive monitoring config --budget-alerts "60,85,95"

# Set performance thresholds
hive monitoring config --response-time-alert 4.0
hive monitoring config --success-rate-alert 92

# Set usage spike threshold
hive monitoring config --usage-spike-threshold 250  # 250% of normal
```

## Advanced Monitoring Features

### Monitoring Sessions

Track different monitoring periods:

```bash
# Start a named monitoring session
hive monitoring start --session "project-launch-week"

# List all monitoring sessions
hive monitoring sessions list

# View session details
hive monitoring session show project-launch-week

# Resume a paused session
hive monitoring session resume project-launch-week
```

**Example session info:**
```
📊 Monitoring Session: project-launch-week

Started: January 15, 2024 at 2:30 PM
Duration: 4 hours, 23 minutes
Status: Active

Statistics:
Total requests monitored: 1,247
Alerts triggered: 5
Budget alerts: 2
Performance alerts: 1
Usage alerts: 2

Recent Activity:
2:45 PM - Budget 50% threshold reached
3:20 PM - Usage spike detected (3.2x normal)
4:15 PM - Budget 80% threshold reached
```

### Alert History and Analysis

Track and analyze past alerts:

```bash
# View alert history
hive monitoring alerts history --days 7

# Analyze alert patterns
hive monitoring alerts analyze

# Export alert data
hive monitoring alerts export --format csv --month current

# Get alert statistics
hive monitoring alerts stats
```

**Example alert analysis:**
```
📈 Alert Analysis (Last 7 Days)

Total Alerts: 23
Most Common: Budget alerts (61%)
Peak Day: Thursday (8 alerts)
Peak Time: 2-4 PM (43% of alerts)

Alert Breakdown:
Budget (14): Mostly 80% threshold warnings

```

### Smart Alert Filtering

Reduce alert noise with intelligent filtering:

```bash
# Set minimum alert interval (prevent spam)
hive monitoring config --min-alert-interval 300  # 5 minutes

# Enable smart grouping (combine similar alerts)
hive monitoring config --group-similar-alerts true

# Set alert priority levels
hive monitoring config --alert-priorities "budget:high,performance:medium,usage:low"

# Quiet hours (no alerts during specified times)
hive monitoring config --quiet-hours "22:00-06:00"
```

## Notification Channels

# Strict alert thresholds
hive monitoring config \
  --budget-alerts "60,80,90,95,98" \
  --response-time-alert 3.0 \
  --success-rate-alert 95

# Multiple notification channels
hive monitoring config --notifications "email,webhook,slack"

# Enable automatic escalation
hive monitoring config --escalate-after 300  # 5 minutes
```

## Troubleshooting Monitoring Issues

### Common Problems

**Monitoring not starting:**
```bash
# Check monitoring service status
hive monitoring service status

# Restart monitoring service
hive monitoring service restart

# Check for configuration errors
hive monitoring config validate

# View monitoring logs
hive monitoring logs --tail 50
```

**Too many alerts:**
```bash
# Increase alert thresholds
hive monitoring config --budget-alerts "70,90,98"

# Enable alert grouping
hive monitoring config --group-similar-alerts true

# Set quiet hours
hive monitoring config --quiet-hours "18:00-09:00"

# Increase minimum alert interval
hive monitoring config --min-alert-interval 600  # 10 minutes
```

**Missing alerts:**
```bash
# Check notification settings
hive monitoring config show

# Test notification channels
hive monitoring test-notification all

# Verify monitoring is active
hive monitoring status

# Check alert history
hive monitoring alerts history --hours 1
```

### Performance Optimization

**Reducing monitoring overhead:**
```bash
# Increase check interval for less frequent monitoring
hive monitoring config --interval 30  # 30 seconds instead of 5

# Monitor only critical metrics
hive monitoring config --metrics "budget,performance"

# Disable detailed logging
hive monitoring config --verbose-logging false

# Optimize alert processing
hive monitoring config --batch-alerts true
```

**Improving alert reliability:**
```bash
# Use multiple notification channels
hive monitoring config --notifications "email,desktop,webhook"

# Set up backup notification methods
hive monitoring config --backup-email backup@company.com

# Enable alert confirmation
hive monitoring config --require-confirmation true

# Set up monitoring health checks
hive monitoring health-check enable
```
