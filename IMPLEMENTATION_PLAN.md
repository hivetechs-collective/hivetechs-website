## Architecture Overview

The HiveTechs Collective platform consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Public Website** - Next.js frontend deployed on Cloudflare Pages
2. **User Dashboard** - Protected area for authenticated users
3. **API Layer** - Interface between frontend and backend services
4. **MCP Service** - Multi-model Consensus Pipeline core technology
5. **Payment Integration** - Initially via Gumroad API, potentially direct Stripe later
6. **Analytics & Monitoring** - Usage tracking and performance monitoring

This architecture follows a separation of concerns principle, where public-facing components are isolated from proprietary technology.

## Security Considerations

### Repository Management

- **Public Repository**: Contains only the website frontend code, UI components, and public documentation
- **Private Repository**: Houses all proprietary algorithms, business logic, API implementations, and sensitive configurations

### Sensitive Information Protection

- No API keys, secrets, or credentials in the codebase
- All sensitive values stored as environment variables in Cloudflare Pages
- No business-critical algorithms or logic in the public repository

### Authentication & Authorization

- Implement industry-standard authentication practices
- JWT-based session management with appropriate expiration
- Role-based access control for different user tiers
- Rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper data sanitization for user inputs
- Follow GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations
- Regular security audits and dependency updates
